                <h3 class="pink">Q: What is this project about?</h3>
                <p>This is a decompilation project for TwinBee PARADISE in Donburi Island and TwinBee's Exciting Wonderland.
                The overall goal is to extract the original source code from the complied code in Macromedia Director and the binaries.
                When the original source code is extracted from the game, it's going to be reversed enginnered so that people can have a better understanding
                of how the game work overall.</p>

            <div class="textbox-2 border">
            <h3 class="green">Q: Why are you decompiling this game?</h3>
            <p>The reason why I decided to decompile this game is because the TwinBee series never really got noticed outside of Japan and doing something like this coud reach more fans or new fans.
            Working with Macromedia Director based games is especially challenging for me since the scripting language "Lingo" is no longer supported and is notoriously difficult to reverse engineer. 
            Macromedia Director is an old software and there's many better game engines that can make the game run without any runtime issues.</p>
            <p>By decompiling this game, we can understand how the game works based on Lingo script and behaviors. It will make it eaiser to reverse engineer the Lingo script into a different programming langauge that is widely used.</p>
            <p>As for TwinBee's Exciting Wonderland, there's a lot of widgets and screensavers that have to be extracted since they aren't has widely used now, but there is a lot of extra content that does have to be saved or experienced.</p>

            <ul>
                <li style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Contribute to the documenting or coding</li>
                <li style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Help with testing or debugging the game</li>
                <li style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Translate any Japanese scripts or text</li>
                <li style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Join the Discord and share the project with others!</b></li>

            <div class="textbox-1 border">
            <h3 class="pink">Q: Do I need coding experience to help?</h3>
            <p>Not necessarily. Even if you can’t reverse engineer raw code, you are always
                welcome to help with documentation, research, and organization. HTML isn't a
                OOP langauge and it's a fairly easy langauge to understand (It's like making a word document).</p>
            <p>If you are experienced in C or used Ghidra, you are welcome to help with decompiling TwinBee's Exciting Wonderland.</p>

            <h3 class="green">Q: Will this lead to a fan translation or port?</h3>
            <p>Possibly! If the decompilation of this game is finished,
                it would make things like fan translations and ports so much easier!
                Any ports and/or fan translations would have their own Github repositories.</p>
